My background is in theoretical physics (quantum fields and strings) and I now work as a data scientist in the pharmaceutical industry, focusing mostly on applications of quantitative methods to drug development and optimization of business processes.

In my spare time, I enjoy ski touring, mountain biking and cycling, especially in the Swiss Alps where I grew up.

In this blog, I am sharing learnings from my data science and applied mathematics journey, so hopefully you won't get stuck at the same sticky places.
