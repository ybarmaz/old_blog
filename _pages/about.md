My background is in theoretical physics (quantum fields and strings) and I now work as a data scientist in the pharmaceutical industry, focusing mostly on applications of quantitative methods to drug development and optimization of business processes.

In my spare time, I enjoy [ski touring, mountain biking](https://www.instagram.com/naxadventurextreme/) and cycling, mostly in the Swiss Alps where I grew up.
